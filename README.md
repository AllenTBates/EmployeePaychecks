EmployeePaychecks is an application designed to read in a text file with employee data
and create three new text files with information regarding the employee.

This first application is a .NET Frameworks Console Application where the project local Employees.txt 
file will be read in and used to create Paychecks.txt, TopEarners.txt, and States.txt. 
Once these files are created, the user will be able to lookup an employee's details by entering 
their employee ID into the console interface.
